A good way to choose a vet is to see if he or she answers your questions promptly and knowledgeably and to see how they interact with your pet. You will need to bring your dog for regular check-ups, so if your vet is too booked up you may want to look for a new one. Feel free to change veterinarians even after you take your dog to one."

You may have a dog that actually requires a ton of exercise and never tires out, for example terriers are often capable of running all day without tiring."

The best way to train a dog is to use the reward system. In this system, a dog is rewarded for complying with its owner’s request through use of a small treat and a ton of praise."
